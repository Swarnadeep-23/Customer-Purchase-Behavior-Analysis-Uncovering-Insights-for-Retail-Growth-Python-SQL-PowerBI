Business Problem Statement

A fast-growing retail company is seeking a deeper, more data-driven understanding of how its customers interact with its products and channels. With rapid shifts in shopping preferences and increasing competition in both online and offline markets, the leadership team wants to uncover the underlying patterns shaping customer behavior. Recent trends indicate noticeable variations in how different demographics shop, which product categories are gaining or losing traction, and how customers respond to promotions, reviews, and seasonal changes.
The company is also noticing shifts in customer loyalty and repeat purchase frequency, but lacks clarity on what is driving these changes. Executives want to identify which factors, such as discount intensity, product ratings, seasonality, payment choices, or shopping channel preferences, have the strongest influence on purchase decisions and long-term customer engagement.
Your role is to dive into the company’s consumer behaviour dataset and uncover actionable insights that answer the central strategic question:

“How can the organization harness customer shopping data to detect emerging trends, increase customer engagement, and shape more effective marketing, product, and retention strategies?”
